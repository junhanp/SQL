# SQL 
everythingCombinedTogetherPlusShowingTables.sql is the file with everything in it:
create.sql
insert.sql
queries.sql

I use Microsoft sql server management 18, and was only able to run everythingCombinedTogetherPlusShowingTables.sql
and create.sql, insert.sql and queries.sql will not run by itself without create.sql.

I added GO at the end of each file for the test

everythingCombinedTogetherPlusShowingTables.sql will work and it is the combination of everything.
